# Challenge Statement
Mobile App

Digitize the enrollment, redepmtion, recoding process

### Clinic
- Patient downlaods the app & registers personal & health data
- Iniital FVRx is loaded for a set period of time

### Grocery Store
- QR/Bar code is scanned at check out
- Discount is redeemed based on total fruit and vegetable spend

Running balance is updated
Physician "reloads" FVRx at a triggered event - next wellness vist, attendance to a nutrition educaiton class, completing an online nutrtion education course, or at a minimum balance
- If possible their account should tie into their elecontric medical record, so that a running record of purchases is maintained and the physician can see redpemtions
